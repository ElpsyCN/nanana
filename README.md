You can find the standard docs in `docs/standard` and read or modify it, it must contain the following content.

* The role of each keyword.
* The grammar and behavior of each statement, using the grammar tentatively designated as "context-free grammar".
* Naming rules and scope rules for symbols.
* The length of memory occupied by the basic types, and if necessary, the encoding method, such as the encoding method for floating point numbers.
* The interface and behavior of the standard library.
* ......

### Step 2

Implement the content in the standard doc in a proper way.
